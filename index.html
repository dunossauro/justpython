<h1>Just python manifesto. </h1>


Most python events today are about many things : frameworks, applications and community. We find that this is very positive and many events meet industry and community needs. But sometimes we just miss python, pure python. 
It is our intent to host just python conferences. Conferences dedicated to code that uses just python and the included batteries. 
We believe that this will take participants out of their comfort zone and stimulate lecturers to take the time and think of new and exciting talks challenging themselves and the audience. 
Our goal is to see this kind of event happening globally in many formats : meetups, conference tracks, entire conferences. 
It is our belief that this conference format is going to appeal to experienced developers that grew tired of the current events. 
But which subjects are allowed? Anything, just follow some simple guidelines :

Preferably it will contain code. 
The code must use only built-in libraries. 
Other languages are allowed only to show implementations of the python core or demonstrate ctypes usage. 
You can show how to implement something in pure python
You can teach how to use core and built-in functionality
You can discuss performance, gotchas and python quirks 
You can talk about python versions and make comparisons. 

You cannot :

Use external libs 
Use frameworks 
Talk about community 


Have fun and letâ€™s code in python.
