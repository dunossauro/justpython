<h1>Just python manifesto. </h1>

<p>
  Most python events today are about many things : frameworks, applications and community.
</p>
<p>
We find that this is very positive and many events meet industry and community needs.
But sometimes we just miss python, pure python.
</p>
<p>
  It is our intent to host just python conferences.
  Conferences dedicated to code that uses just python and the included batteries.
</p>
<p>
  We believe that this will take participants out of their comfort zone and
  stimulate lecturers to take the time and think of new and exciting talks
  challenging themselves and the audience.
</p>
<p>
  Our goal is to see this kind of event happening globally in many formats :
  meetups, conference tracks, entire conferences.
</p>
<p>
  It is our belief that this conference format is going to appeal to experienced
  developers that grew tired of the current events.
</p>
<p>
  But which subjects are allowed? Anything, just follow some simple guidelines :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Preferably it will contain code.
  </li>
  <li>
    The code must use only built-in libraries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other languages are allowed only to show implementations of the python core or demonstrate ctypes usage.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can show how to implement something in pure python
  </li>
  <li>
    You can teach how to use core and built-in functionality
  </li>
  <li>
    You can discuss performance, gotchas and python quirks
  </li>
  <li>
    You can talk about python versions and make comparisons.
  </li>
</ul>
You cannot :
<ul>
  <li>
    Use external libs
  </li>
  <li>
    Use frameworks
  </li>
  <li>
    Talk about community
  </li>
</ul>

Have fun and letâ€™s code in python.
